This is my final project. It is an iOs app built on xCode.

In order to run this app, download xcode on the app store with a Mac and download the iphone simulator. 

Simulate this app on the iPhone 15 Pro.

Once you have opened the project folder with xcode, build the app and run it using command b or the play button on the top left corner.

This app is a habit-tracking app. 

Create an account in the register tab, and then login. This should all function properly but I am using firestore so I'm not entirely certain on whether or not this will work in other computers. This is my first time using xcode so I'm not sure. 

Once you're logged in, use the plus button on the top right hand corner to create a new habit. Choose a name for the habit, the number of times you want to perform it, and on what frequency you want to perform it (daily or weekly)
Then, see your habit appear on the home screen. When you complete your habit, press the "complete" button, and see your number of completions increase by 1.
When the amount of time you indicated has passed (day for daily, week for weekly), the amount of completions will reset and the clock to reset these completions will also be reset to the appropriate amount of time.

I apologize for not showing my face in the video. I used software I was already comfortable with and did not know how to add my face into it. 

Unfortunately, you won't have access to my firebase data due to the fact that it is on a private account. You will however, see the data populate on your screen, and can see through the documentation that the data is uploading correctly.
